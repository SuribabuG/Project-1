History of Java
================
In 1990, Sun Micro System company took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box. That time project was called Stealth project and later it is renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project and they have met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System.James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project.But the problem what they have faced is C and C++ languages are system dependent.Then James Gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language which is system independent. 

In 1991, they have developed a programming language called and OAK.OAK means strength , itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many countries like Germany,France, USA and etc. 

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to Java.Java is a Island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced and during the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence the symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.



Identifiers
===========
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be class name, variable name, method name or label name.

ex:
	class  Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int  x = 10;

			System.out.println(x);
		}		
	}
	Here Test, main , args, x , String , System are identifiers.

Rules to declare an identifiers
-------------------------------
Rule1:
-----
	Identifier will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$

Rule2:
-----
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int  emp_id; //valid 
		int  emp#id; //invalid
		int  emp$alary; //valid  

Rule3:
-----
	Identifier must and should starts with alphabet,underscore or dollar symbol
	but not with digit.
	ex:	
		int   emp123; //valid 
		int   _emp;  //valid 
		int   $emp;  //valid 
		int   1abcd; //invalid 

Rule4:
-----
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int number;
		int NUMBER;
		int NuMbEr; 

Rule5:
-----
	We can't take reserved words as an identifiers.
	ex:
		int  if;
		int  else;
		int  do;
		int  for; 

Rule6:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifier but is not recommanded to take more then 
	15 characters.
