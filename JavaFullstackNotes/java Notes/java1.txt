Naming Conventions in Java
===========================
In java, uppercase letters will consider as different and lowercase letters consider as different.Hence we consider java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive, we must and should follow naming conventions for following things.

ex:
	classes
	interfaces
	variables
	methods
	keywords
	packages
	constants 
	
classes
--------
In java, a class name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	Predefined classes		Userdefined classes
	-----------------		-------------------
	System				Test
	Date				ExampleApp
	StringBuffer 			EmployeeInfo	
	FileWriter 			Department
	and etc.			and etc.
	
interfaces
----------
In java, an interface name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined interfaces		userdefined interfaces
	-----------------		---------------------
	Runnable 			ITest
	Serializable 			IDemoApp
	Cloneable 			IEmployeeDetails
	ListIterator 			IStudentInfo
	and etc.			and etc

variables
----------
In java, a variable name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined variables		userdefined variables
	-----------------------		---------------------
	length				a 
	err				studNo
	out				employeeName
	in				deptNumber
	and etc.			and etc.


methods
--------
In java, a method name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined methods		userdefined methods
	-------------------		-------------------
	getPriority()			getDetails()
	hashCode()			setAmount()
	toString()			calculateBillAmt()	
	setName()			setStudentInfo()
	and etc.			and etc.


keywords
----------
In java, all keywords we need to declare under lowercase letters.

ex:
	predefined keywords
	------------------
	if, else, while, do , public , static , void , for and etc.


packages
---------
In java, all packages we need to declare under lowercase letters only.
ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	----------------		--------------------
	java.lang 			com.ihub.www
	java.io				com.google.www
	java.util			and etc.
	java.util.stream
	java.text
	java.time 
	and etc.

constants 
----------
In java, all constants we need to declare under uppercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined constants		userdefined constants
	---------------			-------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY			LIMIT
	MIN_PRIORITY			N=10
	NORM_PRIORITY
	MAX_VALUE
	MIN_VALUE
	and etc.
