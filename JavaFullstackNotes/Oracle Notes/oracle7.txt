TCL commands
=============
We have three TCL commands.

1) commit 

2) rollback 

3) savepoint 

1) commit 
----------
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

syntax:
------
	commit;

ex:
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	select * from student;// 2 records display 

	commit; 


2) rollback 
-----------
It is used to undo the changes which are not permanent.

syntax:
------
	rollback; 

ex:
---
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

	insert into student values(103,'Alan','Florida');

	insert into student values(104,'Jose','Texas');

	select * from student; // 4 records 

	rollback;

	select * from student; // 2 records 

3) savepoint 
-----------
It is used mark logical transaction in a database.

Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto savepoint.

syntax:
	savepoint  <save_pointe_name>;

ex:

	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	savepoint sp1;

	insert into student values(103,'Alan','Florida');

	insert into student values(104,'Jose','Texas');

	savepoint sp2;

	insert into student values(105,'Jacky','China');

	insert into student values(106,'John','Japan');

	select * from student; // 6 records 

	rollback to sp2;
	
	select * from student; // 4 records 

PSEUDO columns
===============
PSEUDO means a column which is not real.

We have two pseudo columns.

1) ROWNUM 

2) ROWID 

1) ROWNUM
--------
ROWNUM always start with 1 and increment by 1.

ROWNUM values are temperory.

Once the query is executed we will loss the rownum values.

ex:
	select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	select rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;

	select rownum,sno,sname,sadd from student;

2) ROWID 
---------
ROWID is a hexadecimal number.

ROWID is permanent.

ROWID is a memory location where our records will store in a table.

ex:
	select rowid,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rowid,rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;


Interview Queries
----------------------

Q) Write a query to display first four records from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=4;
	or
	select * from emp where rownum<=4 order by rownum;

	select * from emp where rownum<=4 order by rownum desc;



Q) Write a query to display fourth record from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=4
	minus
	select * from emp where rownum<=3;

DCL commands
============
We have two DCL commands.

1) grant 

2) revoke 


Schema : 
-------
	Schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges
---------
	Permission given to a user is called privileges.

	Rights given to a user is called privileges.

	We have two types of privileges.

	1) System privilege
	-------------------
		Permission given by DBA to user.
 
	2) Object privilege 
	------------------
		Permission given by one user to user.



grant 
------
Grant command is used to grant the permissions.

syntax:
	grant <privilege1>,<privilege2> to <user_name>;

revoke
-------
Revoke command is used to revoke the permissions.

syntax:
	revoke <privilge1>,<privilege2> from <user_name>; 


DBA>  alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;  

DBA> create user hemanth identified by hemanth;

DBA> create user tejaswini identified by tejaswini;

DBA>  grant all privileges to hemanth,tejaswini;


Hemanth> conn  hemanth/hemanth  --logon denied

Tejaswini> conn tejaswini/tejaswini  --logon denied 


DBA> grant connect,resource to hemanth,tejaswini;


Hemanth> conn  hemanth/hemanth   -- connected

Tejaswini> conn tejaswini/tejaswini  -- connected


Hemanth> 



create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10));

ALTER USER hemanth quota unlimited on employee;

insert into employee values(201,'Alan',10000);
insert into employee values(202,'Jose',20000);
insert into employee values(203,'Kelvin',30000);
commit;
select * from employee;


Tejaswini> select * from employee; // table or view does not exist


Hemanth> grant select on employee to tejaswini;

Tejaswini> select * from  hemanth.employee;

Tejaswini> delete from hemanth.employee;

Tejaswini> commit;

Hemanth > select * from employee ; // no rows selected

Hemanth > revoke select on employee from tejaswini;

Hemanth> disc 

Tejaswini> disc 

DBA> revoke connect,resource from hemanth,tejaswini;
DBA> revoke all privileges from hemanth,tejaswini;
