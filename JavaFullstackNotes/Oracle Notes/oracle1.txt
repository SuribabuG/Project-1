Types of Data
==============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured Data 

2) Structured Data 

1) Unstructured Data 
---------------------
A data which is not in readable format such type of data is called unstructured.

In general, meaningless data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	201	Lakemba		SYD		NSW		AUS


2) Structured Data 
------------------
A data which is in readable format such type of data is called structured data.

In general, meaning full data is called structured data.

ex:
	unitno	locality	city		state		country
	------	--------	----		-----		--------
	201	Lakemba		SYD		NSW		AUS
	

Oracle 
========
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

Oracle is a product of Oracle Corporation.

Oracle is classified into two types.

					Oracle
					|
		|-------------------------------------------------|
		SQL						PL/SQL
(Structured Query Language)				(Procedural / Structured Query Language)


Client/Server Architecture
==========================
Diagram: oracle1.1

In Client-Server architecture we need to see , how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Frontend
--------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	Java, .Net, Python, Perl and etc.

Communication Channel
----------------------
Communication channel acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
-------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server , MongoDB, DB2 , Sybase, Teradata, NoSQL and etc.


Management System
=================
It is a software which is used to manage the database.

Using management system we can perform following acitivities very easily.

1) Adding the new data 

2) Modifying the existing data 

3) Deleting the unnecessary data 

4) Selecting the required data.


DBMS
=====
A database along with software which is used to manage the database is called database management system.

RDBMS
=====
If database is created based on relational theories is called relational database management system.
ex:
	Oracle 
	MySQL
	SQL Server 
	PostgreSQL
	Teradata 
	Sybase 
	and etc.

Q)What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS database?

DBMS 						RDBMS
-------						-------
DBMS stands Database Management			RDBMS stands for Relational Database
System						Management System.
					
It stores the data in the form of files.	It stores the data in the form of tables.

It is designed to handle small amount of data.	It is designed to handle large amount of data.

It provides support for a single user 		It provides support for multiple users at a time.
at a time.			

Normalization is not possible for DBMS.		Normalization is possible for RDBMS.

No security of data. 				High security of data.



SQL
=====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to interact with oracle database.

It is a case insensitive language.

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verbs.
ex:
	select, update, delete, merge and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon.

It is developed by Mr.Codd in 1972 (By IBM).


Sub languages of SQL
====================
We have five types of sub languages of SQL.

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)

2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrive/Query Language)

4) DCL (Data Control Language)

5) TCL (Transaction Control Language)


1) DDL (Data Definition Language)
---------------------------------
It is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a collection of five commands.

ex:
	create, alter, drop , truncate and rename 


2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)
------------------------------------
It is used to mainpulate the data present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.

ex:
	insert, update, delete and merge 


3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrive/Query Language)
---------------------------------
It is used to retrieve the data present in database.

It is a collection of one command.

ex:
	select 

4) DCL (Data Control Language)
-----------------------------
This language which is used to control the access of data.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke 



5) TCL (Transaction Control Language)
---------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.

It is a collection of three commands.

ex:
	commit, rollback and savepoint 

Table
=====
A table is an object that is used to represent the data.

A table is used to store the data inthe form of rows and columns.

A data which is stored inside the table is a case sensitive.

ex:
	No		Name		Add
	----------------------------------------
	101	|	Alan	|	Florida
	----------------------------------------
	102	|	Jose	|	Texas
	----------------------------------------
	103	|	Ana	|	Vegas
	----------------------------------------
