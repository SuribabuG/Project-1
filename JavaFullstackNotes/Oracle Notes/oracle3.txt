Logical Operators
==================
We have three types of logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT 


1) AND
---------
It will return the records if all conditions are true.

In logical AND operator, all conditions must be from same row.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Lisa'; // no rows selected 

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Kelvin'; // no rows selected 

2) OR
-----
It will return the records if condition is true.

In logical OR operator , condition can be from any row.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Lisa';

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Kelvin';

3) NOT 
-------
It will return the records except the condition.

A <> symbol denoted as not operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where NOT eid=201;
	select * from emp where  eid<>201;
	
	select * from emp where NOT ename='Alan';
	select * from emp where  ename<>'Alan';


Interview Queries
-----------------

Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee id is 201,202,203?

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR eid=202 OR eid=203;

Q) Write a query to display employees information those who are not working in 10 department?

	select * from emp where deptno<>10;
	


Between operator
=================
Between operator will return the records those who are in the range of values.

In between operator , first we need to write lower limit then higher limit.

Between operator takes the support of AND operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid between 201 AND 206;

	select * from emp where deptno between 10 AND 30;

	select * from emp where esal between 30000 AND 50000;



IN operator
===========
IN operator is a replacement of OR operator.

It will return the records those who are matching in the list of values.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);

	select * from emp where deptno IN(10,20,30,40);

	select * from emp where ename IN('Alan','Kelvin','Lisa');


Pattern Matching operators
============================
Pattern matching operatores are used to select the letters from database table.

Pattern matching operators take the support of like keyword.

We have two types of pattern matching operators.

1) Percentage(%)

2) Underscore(_)

1) Percentage(%)
----------------
Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name starts with 'A' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like 'A%';

Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name ends with 'n' letter?
