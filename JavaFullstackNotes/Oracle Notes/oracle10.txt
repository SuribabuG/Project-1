Merge Command
==============
Merge command is a combination of insert and upate command.

student10 table
---------------
create table student10(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10), sadd varchar2(12));
insert into student10 values(101,'raja','hyd');
insert into student10 values(102,'ravi','delhi');
insert into student10 values(103,'ramana','vizag');
commit;

student20 table
---------------
create table student20(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10), sadd varchar2(12));
insert into student20 values(103,'Alan','Texas');
insert into student20 values(104,'Jose','Florida');
commit;

ex:
	merge into student10 s1
	using student20 s2
	ON(s1.sno=s2.sno)
	when matched then 
	update set sname=s2.sname,sadd=s2.sadd
	when not matched then 
	insert values(s2.sno,s2.sname,s2.sadd);
	

	select * from student10; // 2 records merge 

	select * from student20;

PL/SQL
=======
PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to Structured Query Language.

PL/SQL is a extension of SQL and contains following features.

1) We can achieve programming features like control statements, loops and etc.

2) It reduces network traffic.

3) We can display custom error messages by using the concept of exception handling.

4) We can perform related operations by using concept of triggers.


PL/SQL Block
=============
PL/SQL block is also known as PL/SQL program.

ex:

	DECLARE
	-
	-	// Declaration Section 
	-
	BEGIN
	-
	-	// Executale Section 
	-
	EXCEPTION
	-
	-	// Exception Section 	
	-
	END;
	/

Declaration Section 
--------------------
It is used to declare variables, exceptions,  cursors and etc.
It is a optional section.

Executable Section 
----------------
It is used to declare actual code of a PL/SQL block.
It is a mandatory section.

Exception Section
----------------
It contains lines of code which is executed when exception is raised.
It is a optional section.

To see the output in PL/SQL we need to set serveroutput on?

ex:
	SQL>  set    serveroutput  on 



Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display Hello World?

	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
	END;
	/
	
	Here DBMS_OUTPUT is a package name.
	Here PUT_LINE is a procedure name.
	'/' is used to submit the PL/SQL program into database.


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to perform sum of two numbers?

	DECLARE
	A number;
	B number;
	C number;
	BEGIN
	A:=10;
	B:=20;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/
	
Declaration and initialization using single line.
ex:
	DECLARE
	A number:=10;
	B number:=20;
	C number:=A+B;
	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('sum of two numbers is '||C);
	END;
	/
	
Using '&' symbol we can take dynamic values.

ex:
---
	DECLARE 
	A number(3);
	B number(3);
	C number(6);
	BEGIN
	A:=&a;
	B:=&b;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('sum of two numbers is ='||C);
	END;
	/
