2) Underscore (_)
=================

   letter is 'c'?

DDL commands
============
1) create  (tables)

2) alter   (columns)

3) drop    (tables)

4) truncate (rows/records )

5) rename  (tables)


2) alter command
=================
Using alter command we can perform following activities very easily.

i) Add the new columns 

ii) Modifying the existing columns

iii) drop the columns

iv) Renaming the columns 


i) Add the new columns 
-----------------------
Using alter command we can add new columns in a database table.

syntax:
------
	alter table <table_name> ADD (col1 datatype(size),col2 datatype(size)
					,...,colN datatype(size));

ex:
---
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10),pincode number(8));

	update student set state='Telangana' where sno=101;



ii) Modifying the existing columns
----------------------------------
Using alter command we can modify the columns.

We can increase and decrease the size of column only when existing values are fit into new size.

We can change datatype of a column only when that column is empty.

syntax:
------	
	alter table <table_name> modify (col datatype(size));

ex:
	desc student;
		
	alter table student modify (state varchar2(15));
	
	desc student;

	alter table student modify (pincode varchar2(8));

	desc student;


iii) drop the columns
-----------------------
Using alter command we can drop the columns.

syntax:
------
	alter table <table_name> drop (col1,col2,...,colN);

ex:
	alter table student drop (pincode,state);


iv) Renaming the columns
--------------------------
Using alter command we can rename the column names.

syntax:
-------
	alter table <table_name> rename column <old_name> to <new_name>;

ex:
	alter table student rename column sadd to city;

	alter table emp rename column salary to dailywages;

	alter table emp rename column job to designation;


3) drop command
=================
A drop command is used to drop the table from database.

syntax:
	drop table <table_name>;
ex:
	drop table emp;
	drop table student;
	drop table dept;

	
4) truncate command
====================
A truncate command is used to delete the rows permanently.

syntax:
-----
	truncate table <table_name>;

ex:
	truncate table student;
	truncate table dept;
	truncate table emp;


Q) What is the difference between delete and truncate command?

delete						truncate
----------					------------
It is a DML command.				It is a DDL command.

It deletes the records temperory.		It deletes the records permanently.

We can rollback the data.			We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.			Where clause can't be use.


5) rename command
=================
It is used to rename the table name.

syntax:
-----
	rename <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	rename student to students;
	rename dept to department;
	rename emp to employees;


Duplicate table or Copy of a table
====================================
Using create and select command we can create duplicate or copy of a table.

ex:
	create table stud as select * from student;
	create table stud as select * from emp;
	create table stud as select eid,ename,esal from emp;
	create table stud as select * from emp where deptno=10;
	create table stud as select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);
	create table stud as select * from emp where esal is null;
	create table stud as select * from emp where esal>=30000 AND esal<=50000;
	create table stud as select * from emp where ename like 'A%'; 

cl scr
======
It is used to clear the output screen of SQL command prompt.
ex:
	cl scr



What is dual table
==================
A dual table is a dummy table which contains one row and one column.

It is used to perform arithmetic operations and to see the current system date.

ex:
	select 10+20 from dual;
	select 10*3 from dual;
	select sysdate from dual;
	select current_date from dual;




Functions
=========
Functions are used to manipulate the data items and gives the result.

We have two types of functions.

1) Group functions / Multiple row functions
 
2) Scalar functions / Single Row functions 


1) Group functions
--------------------
Group functions are applicable for multiple rows.

We have following list of group functions.

ex:
	sum(), avg(), max(), min(),count(*) and count(expression).


Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each employee?

	select sum(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display average salary of each employee?

	select avg(esal) from emp;


Q) Write a query to display highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display least salary from emp table?

	select min(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display number of records present in a database table?

	select count(*) from emp;


Q) What is the difference between count(*) and count(expression)?

count(*) 
--------
It will return number of records present in database table.

It will include null records.

ex:
	select count(*) from emp;


count(expression)
-----------------
It will return number of values present in databaset table column.

It will not include null values.
ex:
	select count(eid) from emp;
	select count(comm) from emp;
